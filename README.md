# SpringApi

Starter Spring Application
Includes a fully functioning front-end built with and styled by HTML, Javascript and CSS.
On the front end website you are able to add a list of tasks and then add tasks to these lists.
Both the task lists and tasks can be modified with CRUD functionality that is then stored in the backend!
